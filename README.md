# Hearth-Stone-replica

A replica of the turn based game Hearth-Stone
which is a card game that gives each player a deck with a number of cards and players take turns to inflict damage to each other, and the player with zero health points loses.

I worked with 2 other members on this game where we applied Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java and implemented the Mini-Max AI algorithm to allow users to play against AI agents.

You can find a demo of the project here:-
